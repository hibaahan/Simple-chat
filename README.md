# Simple-chat
The SimpleChat Application is an easy-to-use instant messaging platform designed for seamless communication between clients and a central server. It allows users to send messages in real time and execute various commands to manage their connection. Users can gracefully log off, reconnect, or switch servers and ports using simple command-line instructions. Server administrators can monitor client activity, manage connections, and broadcast messages directly from the server console. Additionally, clients are identified by unique login IDs, ensuring that all messages are attributed to their sender. With dynamic port settings and flexible command options, the application provides an efficient and interactive messaging experience for users and administrators alike.
